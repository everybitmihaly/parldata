## Contributing to Parliamentary Debates Open

Welcome to the Parliamentary Debates Open's github repo. We are happy to see you here.

In this project we are developing a tool aiming at making parliamentary speeches open and accessible covering Hungarian parliamentary debates since 1990. For more information see our [README.md.](https://github.com/k-monitor/parldata/blob/master/README.md) 

## Code of Conduct
We would love to have you as a participant in this project. We have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/k-monitor/parldata/blob/master/CODE_of_CONDUCT.md), applicable to all, who are participating in this project. Please read it carefully.

## Where are we now?
We are building the frontend enabling end-users the search of the parliamentary speeches using keywords filtering for year, speaker, and topics. The number of documents in the database are drawn on the histogram, and the results are returned underneath. For earlier phases see our [roadmap.](https://github.com/k-monitor/parldata/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)

## How can you help?
We are seeking for new idea for the next iteration, such as how to develop the design and what other features to include to the platform.
